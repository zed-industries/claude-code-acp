# ACP adapter for the Claude Agent SDK

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40agentclientprotocol%2Fclaude-agent-acp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp)

Use [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview#branding-guidelines) from [ACP-compatible](https://agentclientprotocol.com) clients!

This tool implements an ACP agent by using the official [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview), supporting:

- Context @-mentions
- Images
- Tool calls (with permission requests)
- Following
- Edit review
- TODO lists
- Nested subagent transcripts
- Interactive (and background) terminals
- Custom [Slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)
- Client MCP servers
- Session-scoped long-running goals through the provider-neutral [goal extension](docs/goal-extension.md)
- Structured errors, recovery, and warnings through the opt-in [session failure extension](docs/session-failure-extension.md)
- Tool permission presentation, editable choices, and durable effects through the [permission extension](docs/permission-extension.md)

### Subagent sessions

Subagents are exposed only after bilateral capability negotiation. Until the released ACP SDKs
preserve the draft `clientCapabilities.subagents` field, a supporting client may advertise
`nativeSubagentSessions` in `_meta.jetbrains.air.capabilities`; the adapter mirrors the capability
in its initialize response. The canonical field remains supported and takes precedence once it is
available. Without either client signal, Agent/Task lifecycle keeps its legacy ordinary ACP
tool-call representation and child interactions stay on the root session. Clients that use the
historical `_meta["subagent-transcript"]` capability or `forwardSubagentText` session option retain
the flattened child transcript behavior.

## Session title generation

Set `ACP_DISABLE_TITLE_GENERATION=1` in the adapter process environment to skip its
extra model request for a session title. This applies to every session handled by
the process and is useful for background jobs, CI, and clients that manage titles
themselves. Unset or other values retain automatic generation. Existing titles
and stored summary fallbacks are still published through `session_info_update`.

This adapter-specific option controls the adapter's explicit `generateSessionTitle`
request. Claude Code's native `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE` setting does not
suppress that explicit request.
